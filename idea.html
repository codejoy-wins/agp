        A Christian journey through porn
    </p>
    <p>
        Maybe it's like a nicotine patch for people who want to move away from harder porn.
    </p>
    <p>
        Maybe I just want to express myself about my take on Lust vs. Christianity.
    </p>
    <p>
        Maybe I want to sell this website for a profit and donate some of the proceeds to a good cause.  Boobs for Jesus idk.
    </p>
    <p>
        Maybe it can help provide motivation and helpful captions to do pushups or excercise.
